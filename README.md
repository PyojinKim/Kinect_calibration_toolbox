# Kinect_calibration_toolbox


<section>

## Code

This toolbox contains some useful code in calibrating Kinect, which also replicates my review work in Kinect calibration.

For anyone intersted in this work, you can find details from my review paper ["A review and quantitative comparison of methods for kinect calibration"](http://vlm1.uta.edu/~athitsos/publications/xiang_iwoar2015.pdf) as well as the corresponding [technical report](assets/joint_calibration.pdf).
